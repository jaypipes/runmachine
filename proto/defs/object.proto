// An externally-referenceable object in the runm system. All objects in the
// system have a type, a partition identifier, an external name and a UUID
// identifier.
//
// The runm-metadata service keeps track of the mapping of external names to
// UUIDs for all objects it knows about. Therefore, other services in the runm
// deployment -- such as runm-resource -- only need to store the UUID
// identifier for various concrete objects it manages.
//
// For example, the runm-resource service manages *providers*. The
// runm-resource database stores provider records, with each record having a
// uuid field indicating the external record identifier for the provider.
// However, adminstrators and users probably don't want to refer to a
// particular compute host with a UUID. Instead, the user prefers to refer to
// the compute host using a common hostname. The runm-metadata service is
// responsible for mapping those external names and object types (in this case,
// the object type would be "runm.provider") to the external UUID identifier.
